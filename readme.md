What is Django
Django is a very popular and widely used full stack web development framework for python. It is used by large companies like Instagram and pintrest! The main advantage of django is that you program almost everything using only python.

Installing Django
Django is a python module and can be installed via pip. Simply open your command prompt or terminal and type "pip install django".

Setting up a Project
The first thing we need to do when we want to start using django is setup a project. To do this we will need to create a directory somewhere to store our django project.
Once we've done that we will need to open our command prompt and change into that directory.
Now we will type the following into cmd or terminal: "django-admin startproject"

Next we will change directories again into the name of our project. Once we've done this we can test that our installation was successful by running the command "python manage.py runserver" and going to the highlighted url in our web browser.
